/**
 * The monorepo itself: `alchemy-run/distilled` and the credentials its CI
 * runs on.
 *
 * This is the "GitHub stack" from
 * https://alchemy.run/environments/ci/#the-github-stack — the stack you
 * deploy by hand, once, with an admin profile, so that everything else can
 * deploy itself. It owns two things:
 *
 *   - **The repository.** Settings that are otherwise clicked into the GitHub
 *     UI and forgotten — merge strategy, topics, homepage — live here as
 *     code, and are converged on every deploy.
 *   - **The credentials.** Every Actions secret and variable the workflows in
 *     `.github/workflows` read. The Cloudflare token is minted as code and
 *     written straight into this repo's Actions secrets; the values no API
 *     can mint (a GitHub App private key, a Discord webhook) come from the
 *     environment at deploy time — either exported in the shell, or in a
 *     gitignored `.env` beside this file, which the CLI reads by default
 *     (`--env-file` points at another).
 *
 * What that buys: `.github/workflows/deploy-submodules-stack.yml` can deploy
 * `stacks/distilled-submodules` on every commit to `main`, and
 * `.github/workflows/website.yml` can deploy the site on the same account.
 *
 * NEVER deployed from CI. It mints credentials, so it needs privileges no CI
 * run should hold — see the admin-profile warning in the docs above. Deploy
 * it manually, with whichever externally-sourced credentials you hold in the
 * environment:
 *
 * ```sh
 * cd stacks/distilled-monorepo
 * DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL=<#releases webhook> \
 * ALCHEMY_VERSION_BOT_PRIVATE_KEY="$(cat alchemy-version-bot.pem)" \
 * DISTILLED_REPOS_PAT=<org fine-grained PAT> \
 *   pnpm exec alchemy deploy --stage prod --profile <admin profile>
 * ```
 *
 * A bare deploy with none of them set still converges everything else, and
 * lists the secrets it left alone. That matters because GitHub hands an
 * existing secret's value back to nobody: requiring all of them would make
 * every deploy wait on re-fetching credentials that are already in place. A
 * value you no longer hold has to be rotated at its source and passed in
 * fresh.
 *
 * The org PAT is the exception, because GitHub has no endpoint for creating
 * PATs at all. It is read from `DISTILLED_REPOS_PAT` when set, otherwise the
 * deploying profile's own signed-in GitHub token is stored.
